Optical Character Recognition is a project in which text written in an image is extracted and converted into plain text form.
It is a widespread technology to recognise text inside images, such as scanned documents and photos. 
OCR technology is used to convert virtually any kind of images containing written text (typed, handwritten or printed) into machine-readable text data.
